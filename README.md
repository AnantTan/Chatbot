# Chatbot
AI chatbot which acts as a customer agent for businesses
Our project is about creating an AI based customer service chatbot, that can 
handle the initial queries of customers that they may have regarding to the product they bought.
Over the past few years, the world of technology has evolved and emerged from time to time which
have changed how we do things in our 
daily life. Artificial intelligence and 
machine learning is one of the new 
technologies, which has recently 
become part of our every daily life and 
because of its versatile nature, this 
technology is being used and 
implemented by a number of industries 
like tech companies, agriculture 
industry, health department and many 
more.
Recently the number of online 
customers has increased exponentially, 
so do their queries and issues with the 
products they have bought. 
As well have reported issues like:
● Current customer support team is not able to keep up with this rapid growth. Which leads to next 
point
● Slow Customer support, because of limited staff.
● Not available all the time.

So having these issues in mind we wanted to Develop a Chatbot that can be part of any E-commerce
websites Customer support service, more specifically an AI chatbot that can perform certain real 
human tasks in customer support by answering customer queries via text message interfaces. This 
AI Chatbot will be designed in a way so that it can handle the initial queries of customers that they 
may have regarding to the product they bought. So, that customers don’t have to wait for the agent, 
instead they can simply start typing the query to get the solution.
